    <font size="18"><b><li>Q: Why \"Today\" and \"Month\" is disabled?</li></b></font>\n
    <font size="16">A:Make sure you have turned on \"Jiejie\". Select Jiejie->Setting->Accessibility->On</font>\n\n

    <font size="18"><b><li>Q: Can I enlarge Today or Month to see clearly?</li></b></font>\n
    <font size="16">A:Yes. You could use your two fingers to zoom in and out.</font>\n\n

    <font size="18"><b><li>Q:Q: Why should I activate device for myself?</li></b></font>\n
    <font size="16">A:If you set time limits for yourself, and if you use your cellphone out of time, it could lock the cellphone for you.</font>\n\n

    <font size="18"><b><li>Q:How can I uninstall Jiejie？</li></b></font>\n
    <font size="16">A:Go to "Home", select  Settings->Security->Device administrators, and now you could uninstall \"Jiejie\".</font>\n\n

    <font size="16">A:Every half a minute..</font>\n\n

    <font size="18"><b><li>Q:Why some apps show in "Today" but not in "Month"？</li></b></font>\n
    <font size="16">A:It only shows the top 10 apps mostly used in today and this month. If certain app does not show in \"Today\" but shows in \"Month\", it means this app is out of the top 10 in terms of month.</font>\n\n

    <font size="18"><b><li>Q:Why some apps cannot show in \"Today\"</li></b></font>\n
    <font size="16">A:As in above, it only shows the top 10 mostly used apps.</font>\n\n

    <font size="18"><b><li>Q:Why I can not see my family member data？</li></b></font>\n
    <font size="16">A:Because your family has not installed \"Jiejie\", or he does not bind his cellphone number to yours correctly.</font>\n\n

    <font size="18"><b><li>Q:Why I can see only \"Today\" for my family member?</li></b></font>\n
    <font size="16">A:This version can only see \"Today\".</font>\n\n

    <font size="18"><b><li>Q:Why I cannot monitor my family member?</li></b></font>\n
    <font size="16">A:Your family has not yet installed \"Jiejie\", or he does not bind his cellphone number to yours correctly.</font>\n\n

    <font size="18"><b><li>Q:How can I bind cellphone numbers?</li></b></font>\n
    <font size="16">A:Select setting->Input cell phone number, and then input your cellphone number. Click on "Next"</font>\n\n

    <font size="18"><b><li>Q:What is the function of Jiejie Setting->Setting times？</li></b></font>\n
    <font size="16">A:If you set time limits, Jiejie can lock your cellphone for you if you run out of time.</font>\n\n

    <font size="18"><b><li>Q:Why I cannot lock my cellphone?</li></b></font>\n
    <font size="16">A:Make sure you have checked the \"Lock\" on \"Exceed time\" item, and also make sure to select \"Activate device administrator\".</font>\n\n
